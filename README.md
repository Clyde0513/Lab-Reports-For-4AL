# Lab-Reports-For-4AL

This is a Physics Lab and these labs were scored over 90 and they've helped me throughut this course. My TA Alexander Galkin was super helpful and accomodating :D. 
In addition, my labmates were super awesome and cool in the labs and the final project

#To run the final project code

import the necessary files: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and download the jupyter extension on vscode

NOTE: make sure you put all the txt files the same directory as the final python file
